# gramRanker

Bringing you the most popular Instagram posts every day, every hour.

* Used simple probability to accurately rank millions of Instagram posts. Instagram's API does not have a 'most-engaging-posts' endpoint.
* Built 2 scrapers to get account and media data.
* Used YQL to circumvent CORS and avoid making more calls from my server.
* Application runs on Node. Used Express.js as the server side framework, CSS and Flexbox for client side. Mongolabs as my database, AWS as my host, and Namecheap as my DNS.
